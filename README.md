# Running Playwright Tests in Docker and Locally

This repository contains instructions on how to set up and run Playwright tests both within a Docker container and locally on your machine. Playwright is a Node.js library for automating browsers, and running tests in Docker ensures consistency across different environments, while running tests locally allows for quick iterations and debugging.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone repository and navigate there:**

git clone https://github.com/ligob1/sample-auth.git
cd sample-auth

2. **Install Dependencies:**

npm install

3. **Build Docker Image:**

docker build -t playwright-tests 

## Running Tests in Docker

Once you have set up the environment, you can run the tests inside a Docker container.

### Command:

docker run --rm playwright-tests

This command will execute all the Playwright tests within the Docker container.

## Running Tests Locally

You can also run the tests directly on your local machine.

### Command:

npx playwright test


This command will execute all the Playwright tests locally using the installed Node.js environment.

## Additional Notes

- **Environment Configuration**: Environment configuration files are placed in the `/env` directory. Make sure to update these files as necessary for your specific environment.
- **Parallel Execution**: By default, tests are configured to run in parallel. Playwright supports parallel execution, which can significantly reduce test execution time.
- **Playwright Documentation**: Options on how to run tests with Playwright can be found in the [official documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests).
- **Test Scripts**: Playwright test scripts should be placed within the `/tests` directory. The Docker image will use these scripts for execution.
- **Dockerfile**: The Dockerfile provided in the repository specifies the configuration for the Docker image. You can customize it according to your requirements.
- **Playwright Configuration**: Ensure that your Playwright tests are configured properly to run in headless mode or with a specific browser instance. Adjust configurations as needed in your test scripts.
