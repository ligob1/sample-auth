# Running Playwright Tests in Docker and Locally

This repository contains instructions on how to set up and run Playwright tests both within a Docker container and locally on your machine. Playwright is a Node.js library for automating browsers, and running tests in Docker ensures consistency across different environments, while running tests locally allows for quick iterations and debugging.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the Provided Repository Directory:**

cd <provided-repository-directory>

2. **Install Dependencies:**

npm install

3. **Build Docker Image:**

docker build -t playwright-tests 

## Running Tests in Docker

Once you have set up the environment, you can run the tests inside a Docker container.

### Command:

docker run --rm playwright-tests

This command will execute all the Playwright tests within the Docker container.

## Running Tests Locally

You can also run the tests directly on your local machine.

### Command:

npx playwright test


This command will execute all the Playwright tests locally using the installed Node.js environment.

## Running Tests on CI with Latest Docker Image

You can run the tests on your CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline using the latest Docker image.

### Example CI Configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions)

name: Run Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t playwright-tests .

    - name: Run tests
      run: docker run --rm playwright-tests

This configuration assumes you're using GitHub Actions. Adjustments may be needed for other CI systems.

## Additional Notes

- **Environment Configuration**: Environment configuration files are placed in the `/env` directory. Make sure to update these files as necessary for your specific environment.
- **Parallel Execution**: By default, tests are configured to run in parallel. Playwright supports parallel execution, which can significantly reduce test execution time.
- **Playwright Documentation**: Options on how to run tests with Playwright can be found in the [official documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests).
- **Test Scripts**: Playwright test scripts should be placed within the `/tests` directory. The Docker image will use these scripts for execution.
- **Dockerfile**: The Dockerfile provided in the repository specifies the configuration for the Docker image. You can customize it according to your requirements.
- **Playwright Configuration**: Ensure that your Playwright tests are configured properly to run in headless mode or with a specific browser instance. Adjust configurations as needed in your test scripts.
